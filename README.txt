AssignmentOne reading from a file

This code checks if a file exists, and if that file exists, checks for syntax errors
in the form of checking delimiters to see if they are complete. If they are not
complete, the program will output the line where the error occurs. Corey and Ryan Kassab
helped me with debugging my pointer error that I had.
